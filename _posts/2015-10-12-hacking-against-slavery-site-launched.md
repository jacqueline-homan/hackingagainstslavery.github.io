The intention of this blog is to create a way for people to learn about what the collective known as hacking against slavery is up to.  This collective was founded by Eric Schles back in 2010 at a hackathon @ NYU Courant.  While Eric has left NYU and continued to work with many capable collaborators and wonderful people.  It is from these simple, informal beginnings that this long term collaboration took form.  The end goal is to create free tools to end slavery around the world.
